# MOVIES_SCHEMA_DESIGN

**Design a movies database.**
- <b>Each movie has a title and year, one (and only one) director, and some number of actors.</b>
Actors can star in multiple movies. Directors can direct multiple movies. <br>
Some movies have the same title such as Oceanâ€™s Eleven (the 2001 version directed by Steven Sodenbergh had George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, and many others, 
but the 1960 version was directed by Lewis Milestone and starred Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr).
